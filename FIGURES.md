# Figures

A visual index of the result figures produced by each stage's `plot_*.py` script, with the
physics each one demonstrates. Every figure is written to its stage's `results/` directory by
reading that stage's `diags/` openPMD output — `results/` is git-ignored, so regenerate the PNGs
by re-running the plot script (or the full pipeline). The figures that *are* committed are added
explicitly with `git add -f warpx_<stage>/results/*.png`.

Regenerate everything:

```bash
conda activate CBB
python warpx_cathode/plot_cathode.py          # → warpx_cathode/results/
python warpx_gun/plot_gun.py                  # → warpx_gun/results/
python warpx_prebuncher/plot_prebuncher.py    # → warpx_prebuncher/results/ (all P* cases)
```

The chain is order-dependent — each stage accelerates/transports the previous stage's beam:

```
cathode  ─►  gun  ─►  prebuncher
(SCL diode)  (~148 keV)  (RF bunching)
```

## 1. Cathode — `warpx_cathode/results/`

Finite-extent, space-charge-limited (Child–Langmuir) diode in **2D x–z**: cathode plane at
`z = 0` (0 V), anode at `z = d = 0.1 mm` (+50 V), electrons emitted only from the finite patch
`|x| < 6 mm`. The run deliberately **over-injects at 2× J_CL** and lets the self-consistent
fields do the limiting — the answer is not imposed. Produced by `plot_cathode.py`.

### `child_langmuir.png` — the validation
![Child–Langmuir validation](warpx_cathode/results/child_langmuir.png)

On-axis (center of the cathode) potential `φ(z)` and longitudinal field `E_z(z)` from WarpX,
overlaid with the 1D planar Child–Langmuir laws `φ = V(z/d)^{4/3}`,
`E_z = −(4V/3d)(z/d)^{1/3}` and the vacuum (no-space-charge) linear reference. The WarpX curve
sits right on the 4/3-power potential, and the field is **driven to ≈0 at the cathode** instead
of uniform — the defining signature of space-charge-limited emission (the virtual cathode
reflecting excess current).

### `cathode_2d.png` — the 2D structure
![2D maps of ρ, φ, |E|](warpx_cathode/results/cathode_2d.png)

Three side-by-side 2D maps across the gap: charge density `|ρ|` (√/PowerNorm scale), potential
`φ`, and field magnitude `|E|`. The white bar marks the emitting cathode patch (z = 0,
`|x| < 6 mm`). You can see (1) the dense space-charge / virtual-cathode layer hugging the
emitting strip, (2) the potential depression in the beam column, and (3) the **field transition
at the cathode edges** `x = ±6 mm`, where the field-suppressed emitting strip meets the full
vacuum field outside — the finite-cathode signature absent from planar theory.

### `current_saturation.png` — self-limiting emission
![Transmitted current saturating at J_CL](warpx_cathode/results/current_saturation.png)

Transmitted current density at the anode vs. time (integrated across the beam, referenced to the
cathode width `2R`). Despite injecting **2× J_CL** (red dotted reference, above this zoomed view),
the transmitted current ramps up during gap-fill and then settles near `J_CL` (dashed,
≈ 8.25 × 10⁴ A/m²; slightly above it, ≈ 110% in this run — the wide cathode / narrow gap is deep
in the 1D limit and the finite cathode temperature pushes emission just past the cold-emission
value). The cathode does **not** pass the 2× current it is fed; space charge regulates it.
Linear y-axis anchored at the
origin so both the turn-on ramp and the plateau-vs-`J_CL` are visible to scale.

### `rho_z_time.png` — space-charge cloud build-up
![On-axis charge density vs. time](warpx_cathode/results/rho_z_time.png)

On-axis charge density `|ρ|(z, t)` (√ scale) over the turn-on transient — the space-charge cloud
building up and filling the gap (gap-fill ≈ 480 steps). Time sampling is non-uniform (dense
through the transient, sparse in steady state), so it is drawn with `pcolormesh` on the true time
coordinates rather than `imshow`, which would distort the time axis.

### `field_lines.png` — the 2D cathode-edge field enhancement
![Equipotentials + E-field streamlines, with a zoom on the cathode edge](warpx_cathode/results/field_lines.png)

φ equipotential contours overlaid on E-field streamlines (coloured by `|E|`) across the gap, with a
zoom on the `+x` cathode edge. Planar Child–Langmuir theory is 1D — flat equipotentials, straight
field — but the cathode is **finite**: the space-charge-suppressed emitting strip (`|x| < 6 mm`,
white bar) meets the full vacuum field outside. At the edges `x = ±6 mm` (dotted lines) the
equipotentials **crowd together and the streamlines splay** as `|E|` climbs from its suppressed value
on the emitting surface up to the uniform vacuum field outside — the **field transition** at the
emission edge (a transition, not an overshoot: `|E|` rises monotonically to `V/d` and does not exceed
it), the finite-cathode signature the planar picture cannot show. The contour companion to the `φ`
panel of `cathode_2d.png`.

### `emission_phase_space.png` — the source's thermal emittance
![Transverse phase space x–ux and the thermal momentum spread](warpx_cathode/results/emission_phase_space.png)

The intrinsic (thermal) beam quality of the source, from the last particle snapshot. **Left:**
transverse phase space `x` vs. `ux = γβ_x` (density via hexbin), annotated with the RMS normalized
emittance `εn,x = √(⟨x²⟩⟨ux²⟩ − ⟨x·ux⟩²) ≈ 1.57 mm·mrad` — the irreducible emittance every downstream
stage inherits. **Right:** the histogram of `ux`, the Maxwellian transverse-momentum spread set by
the 1200 K cathode, with the expected `±√(kT/mₑc²)` scale overlaid (the run reproduces it: rms
`ux` = 0.45 × 10⁻³ vs. √(kT/mc²) = 0.45 × 10⁻³).

## 2. Gun — `warpx_gun/results/`

CESR electrostatic gun ("Chili Gun Mk II", ~150 kV) in **RZ**, using the Poisson–Superfish field
map `CESR_gun.gdf` scaled to a −150 kV cathode. The gun field is applied as an external electrode
field; WarpX supplies the self-consistent space charge on top. The injected beam is the cathode
exit phase space, slab→radius remapped and renormalized to a 0.1 nC bunch. Produced by
`plot_gun.py`.

### `gun_field.png` — the accelerating field
![On-axis gun field and potential](warpx_gun/results/gun_field.png)

Left: on-axis applied field `E_z(z)` (MV/m) of the scaled `CESR_gun.gdf` map — negative
(accelerating in +z), `≈ −1.94 MV/m` at the cathode and peaking `≈ −4.88 MV/m` near z ≈ 28 mm.
Right: the implied on-axis potential `V(z) = −∫E_z dz` (cathode → exit), a total ~150 kV drop.
This is the field the beam sees.

### `beam_rz.png` — transport through the gun
![r–z beam distribution at three snapshots](warpx_gun/results/beam_rz.png)

`r–z` 2D histograms (log color) of the beam at three snapshots — launch, mid-gun, exit — showing
transport through the gun, including the near-cathode radial focusing as the beam accelerates.

### `energy_gain.png` — energy gain along the gun
![Mean and max KE vs. ⟨z⟩](warpx_gun/results/energy_gain.png)

Mean and max kinetic energy of the beam vs. mean position `⟨z⟩`, climbing toward the 150 keV
gun-voltage line (dotted). The gain tracks `∫ e·|E_z| dz` (≈ 7.5 keV by z ≈ 4 mm), approaching the
~150 keV cathode→exit potential drop (mean exit KE ≈ 148 keV).

### `exit_phase_space.png` — exit beam
![Exit longitudinal phase space and energy spectrum](warpx_gun/results/exit_phase_space.png)

Left: longitudinal phase space (`z` vs. `KE`) at the last dump. Right: the final energy spectrum
(histogram) with `⟨KE⟩` marked — a narrow distribution at ~148 keV, the beam handed off to the
prebuncher.

### `beam_envelope.png` — radial envelope and emittance
![RMS radial size σ_r and normalized emittance vs ⟨z⟩](warpx_gun/results/beam_envelope.png)

The near-cathode focusing that `beam_rz.png` shows only as three snapshots, quantified along the
gun. **Blue:** the RMS radial size `σ_r = √⟨x²⟩` contracts from ≈ 2.47 mm as the diverging cathode
emission is focused by the radial gun field, reaching a waist near the exit. **Red (twin axis):**
the normalized transverse emittance `εn,x = √(⟨x²⟩⟨ux²⟩ − ⟨x·ux⟩²)` grows as space charge and
field nonlinearities act — the beam-quality cost of the transport.

### `space_charge.png` — the beam's own space-charge field
![r–z maps of self charge density ρ and the space-charge potential well φ](warpx_gun/results/space_charge.png)

The beam **self-field** dumped to `diags/fields` (`ρ`, `φ`) — distinct from the *applied* gun field
in `gun_field.png`, and plotted nowhere else. At a near-launch snapshot (`⟨z⟩ ≈ 0.4 mm`, beam still
near the cathode where the self-field is largest): **top**, the self charge density `ρ(r, z)` of the
electron bunch (`ρ < 0`); **bottom**, the **space-charge potential well** `φ(r, z)` it digs (≈ −250 V
for the 0.1 nC bunch). This is the field the README renormalizes the bunch to 0.1 nC to control —
the raw ~102 nC cathode population would dig a well that dwarfs the gun field and blows the beam apart.

## 3. Prebuncher — `warpx_prebuncher/results/`

CESR standing-wave RF prebuncher (214 MHz TM cavity) in **RZ** that velocity-bunches the gun's
exit beam (~148 keV, β ≈ 0.63, 0.1 nC) in the downstream 1.3 m drift. Because the bunch is
already short and space-charge dense, the honest metric is bunching **relative to a drift-only
baseline** (`P = 0`): `σ_z,drift(z) / σ_z,cavity(z)`. Produced by `plot_prebuncher.py`, which
writes a `*_line.png`, `*_phasespace.png`, `*_cavity.png`, and `*_bunch_profile.png` for
**every** `diags/P*` case directory present, plus a cross-case `compare_power_phase.png` when a
baseline or multiple cases exist.

Case names are `P<power>_<phase>`: `<phase>` is `zc` (zero-crossing → ballistic bunching) or
`crest` (max energy gain, little bunching); `P0_drift` is the drift-only baseline.

### `P800_zc_line.png` — bunch length, current, energy
![P800 zero-crossing: σ_z vs. drift, peak current, mean KE](warpx_prebuncher/results/P800_zc_line.png)

For one case (here 800 W zero-crossing). **Left:** bunch length `σ_z(z)` for the cavity run vs.
the interpolated drift baseline (`k--`), with the max-bunching point starred
(`σ_drift/σ_cavity`, ≈ 5.4× for this case) and the cavity gap marked. The drift beam expands
0.985 → ~19 mm over the line; the cavity suppresses this and reaches a transient focus.
**Right:** peak current `I_peak(z)` and mean `KE(z)` along the line on twin axes.

### `P800_zc_phasespace.png` — the chirp flipping through the cavity
![P800 zero-crossing: z–KE phase space at three points](warpx_prebuncher/results/P800_zc_phasespace.png)

Mean-subtracted longitudinal `z–KE` phase space at three points: injection, cavity exit, and the
best ballistic focus (the `σ_drift/σ_cavity` maximum when a drift baseline is present, otherwise the
post-cavity `σ_z` minimum — ⟨z⟩ ≈ 446 mm here). The gun beam arrives with an intrinsic **+1.40 keV/mm** (debunching) chirp; the
zero-crossing cavity adds a negative chirp, flipping the net slope and rotating the distribution
so it compresses downstream. (On-crest cases, by contrast, mostly shift up in energy without a
chirp flip — visible by comparing a `crest` phasespace figure.)

### `P800_zc_cavity.png` — the RF drive the bunch sees
![P800 zero-crossing: scaled on-axis Ez(z) and the cos/sin RF waveform at the gap](warpx_prebuncher/results/P800_zc_cavity.png)

The cavity field itself (the σ_z / phase-space figures show only the beam's response). **Left:**
on-axis `Ez(z)` of the 1-J map scaled by this case's field `scale` (≈ 8.2 MV/m peak at 800 W),
placed at the lab gap (`Z_GAP_CENTER` = 0.20 m) via the map's `grid_global_offset`, with the
injection plane marked. **Right:** the temporal RF waveform `E ∝ cos(ω t+φ)`, `B ∝ sin(ω t+φ)`
(90° out of phase) over ~2 RF periods around the bunch-centre gap-arrival `t_gap`, each normalised
to ±1, with the bunch `±σ_t` width shaded. For `zc` the bunch centre lands on the field
**zero-crossing** (annotated) → velocity bunching; for `crest` it lands on the **crest** → pure
acceleration. This is what makes "zero-crossing vs. crest" visual.

### `P800_zc_bunch_profile.png` — the real longitudinal bunch shape λ(z)
![P800 zero-crossing: line-charge density λ(z) at injection, cavity exit, max bunching](warpx_prebuncher/results/P800_zc_bunch_profile.png)

The line-charge density `λ(z−⟨z⟩)` (histogram of `z` weighted by `w·q_e` ÷ bin width, in nC/m) at
the **same** three snapshots as the phase-space figure. Unlike the scalar `σ_z` curve this shows
the bunch's actual shape: a clean peak at injection (σ_z ≈ 0.98 mm), pronounced **space-charge
filamentation spikes** at the cavity exit (σ_z ≈ 2.1 mm, peak `λ` halved), and the **recompressed**
profile at the ballistic focus (σ_z back to ≈ 1.1 mm, peak `λ` ≈ 45 nC/m). Peak `λ` and `σ_z` are
annotated per panel; a drift baseline is overlaid when present (guarded — none on disk in the
current single-case tree).

### `compare_power_phase.png` — scan summary *(when present)*
A cross-case figure written only when several cases / the drift baseline have been run (e.g. via
repeated `prebuncher_sim.py` runs, one `--outdir` per power). **Left:** `σ_z(z)` for the drift baseline
vs. each zero-crossing power. **Right:** max bunching `σ_drift/σ_cavity` vs. RF power, for the
zero-crossing and on-crest phases. (Not committed in the current tree — regenerate by running
multiple powers; see `warpx_prebuncher/README.md`.)

`plot_prebuncher.py` also prints a summary table to stdout for every case (σ_z0, σ_z,min,
bunching factor, focus z, I_peak, final KE).
