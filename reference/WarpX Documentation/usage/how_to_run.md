# Run WarpX

To run a new simulation, please follow these steps:

1. Create a **new directory**, where the simulation will run.
2. Make sure the WarpX **executable** is either copied into this directory or in your `PATH` [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).
3. Add an **inputs file** in the same directory. On [HPC systems](../install/hpc.md#install-hpc), add also a **job submission script**.
4. Run the executable.

## Simulation Directory

On Linux/macOS, this is as easy as:

```bash
mkdir -p <run_directory>
```

Where `<run_directory>` is the actual path to the run directory.

## Executable File

If you installed WarpX with a [package manager](../install/users.md#install-methods), a `warpx`-prefixed executable will be available as a regular system command.
Depending on build options, the executable name includes additional suffixes.
Try it like this:

```bash
warpx<TAB>
```

Pressing the `<TAB>` key will suggest available WarpX executables found in your `PATH` [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).

#### NOTE
WarpX provides a separate binary for each dimensionality: 1D, 2D, 3D, RZ, RCYLINDER, and RSPHERE.
We encode the supported dimensionality in the binary file name.

If you [compiled the code yourself](../install/cmake.md#install-build-cmake), the WarpX executable is located in the source tree under `build/bin`.
A symbolic link named `warpx` pointing to the most recently built executable is also created; you can copy either that link or the binary into your run directory.
Copy the **executable** to this directory:

```bash
cp build/bin/<warpx_executable> <run_directory>/
```

where `<warpx_executable>` should be replaced by the actual name of the executable (see above) and `<run_directory>` by the actual path to the run directory.

## Input File

You need to provide WarpX with an input file that configures the simulation.
This can either be a parameter list or a Python script, depending on how you wish to run WarpX.

To run the WarpX executable, add a **parameter list** file in the directory (see [examples](examples.md#usage-examples) and [parameters](parameters.md#running-cpp-parameters)).
This is a text file containing the numerical and physical parameters that define the simulation.

To run WarpX through the Python interface, add a **PICMI Python script** (see [examples](examples.md#usage-examples) and [PICMI parameters](python.md#usage-picmi-parameters)).
This is a Python script that defines the numerical and physical parameters using the [PICMI standard](https://picmi-standard.org/).

On [HPC systems](../install/hpc.md#install-hpc), also copy and adjust a submission script that allocates computing nodes for you.
Please [reach out to us](../index.md#contact) if you need help setting up a template that runs with ideal performance.

## Run Simulation

### WarpX Executable

Run the executable directly, e.g. with MPI:

```bash
cd <run_directory>

# run with an inputs file:
mpirun -np <n_ranks> ./warpx <input_file>
```

Here, `<n_ranks>` is the number of MPI ranks used, and `<input_file>` is the name of the parameter list.
Note that the actual executable might have a longer name, depending on build options.

The example above uses the copied executable in the current directory (`./`). If you installed WarpX with a package manager, omit the `./` because WarpX will be found in your `PATH`.

### Python Script

Run via the Python interface:

```bash
# run with a PICMI input script:
mpirun -np <n_ranks> python <python_script>
```

Here, `<n_ranks>` is the number of MPI ranks used, `<python_script>` is the name of the [PICMI](python.md#usage-picmi) script.

### Job Script

On an [HPC system](../install/hpc.md#install-hpc), you would instead submit the [job script](../install/hpc.md#install-hpc) at this point, e.g. `sbatch <submission_script>` (SLURM) or `bsub <submission_script>` (LSF).

## Outputs and Diagnostics

By default, WarpX writes status updates to the terminal (`stdout`).
On [HPC systems](../install/hpc.md#install-hpc), it is common to store a copy of this in a file called `outputs.txt`.

By default, WarpX also writes an exact copy of all explicitly and implicitly used input parameters to a file named `warpx_used_inputs` (this filename can be changed).
This is important for reproducibility, since, as noted above, options from the input file can be extended or overridden from the command line.

[Further configured diagnostics](parameters.md#running-cpp-parameters-diagnostics) are explained in the next sections.
By default, they are written to a subdirectory in `diags/` and can use various [output formats](../dataanalysis/formats.md#dataanalysis-formats).
